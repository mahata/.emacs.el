## .emacs.el

According to my `package-activated-list`, following external packages are needed:

```
(ac-helm auto-complete auto-complete-clang-async auto-highlight-symbol dash dropdown-list elscreen epc ctable concurrent deferred exec-path-from-shell expand-region fringe-helper helm-ag helm-git-grep helm-gtags helm helm-core async markdown-mode pkg-info epl popup s sequential-command simple-httpd smartrep wgrep-helm wgrep)
```

I'm pretty sure that some of them aren't actually used in my `.emacs.el`, though...
